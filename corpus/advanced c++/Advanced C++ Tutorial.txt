Advanced C++ Tutorial
Discover intermediate to advanced C++, including the fantastic new features added in C++ 11




Level Up Your C++ Skills
Step-up your C++ knowledge. Discover a skill that pays off for life. And explore one of the world’s most popular programming languages.


Looking For The Next Step?
C++ is one of the world’s most in-demand programming languages.

From coding 3D games to high-performance software, it’s an incredibly useful skill.

And with this course, you’ll learn how to take your C++ skills to the next level.



But advanced doesn’t need to be difficult

I’ve designed this course to break down complex topics into simple tutorials.

With 15 hours of easy-to-use video lessons, you’ll learn how to progress from knowing basic C++ to being able to use advanced C++ syntax.

The Standard Template Library (STL). Move constructors. Smart pointers. Lambda expressions...

...It’s a challenging but incredibly rewarding way to step-up your C++ knowledge.



Here’s what you’ll learn:
Learn to use the popular and highly-useful built-in Standard Template Library (STL).
Use C++ 11's great new features, including lambda expressions and move constructors.
Learn how to create a program that generates fractal images, with smart pointers and binary file handling.
We’ll study C++ file handling, template classes, operator overloading, lambda expressions, smart pointers & move constructors.
Discover how to write high-performance software that uses memory efficiently.
Test your knowledge with exercises ranging from easy near the start, to quite tricky (but optional!).

Requirements:

John Purcell
After working as a software developer and contractor for over 14 years for a whole bunch of companies including CSC, Proquest, SPSS and AT&T in the UK and Netherlands, I decided to work full-time as a private software trainer. I moved to the beautiful city of Budapest, where I turned Cave of Programming from just a bunch of articles into what you see today. After spending a year in Berlin, I moved back to my roots and I now live in Derby, UK.
