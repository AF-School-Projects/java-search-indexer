Overview
Advanced C++ is the third course in the Microsoft Learning C++ series. Students will learn about a vide variety of high-level C++ software development techniques.

It is highly recommended that students complete both the “Introduction to C++” and “Intermediate C++” courses before attempting this one. However, with a solid understanding of the prerequisites, it is not absolutely necessary to take these courses. Prerequisites include an understanding of pointers, memory allocation, file processing, and general OOP concepts.

This course will cover the following concepts: Exceptions, C++ templates, Iterators and advanced Class mechanics, and design patterns.

Short answer: Skip this class. There are so many things wrong. If I didn't suspect better, it almost looks like the class was deliberately constructed to turn people off to C++. I don't mean to sound too negative, but most of this class is just unnecessarily painful to go through. I've done a lot of programming and what little okay material is offered here is buried in a mass of poor presentation, nutty quiz questions, old (really old) content, and just plain bad C++. It's a shame.

The course is merely an introduction to some advanced topics. The course material is of poor quality, the videos are useless, the texts are erroneous , the quiz question are not clear and sometimes "correct" answers are the wrong ones.

Want to code like it's 1998? Want to learn poor C++ with examples that haven't been tested and videos that are barely readable and often inaudible? Want to learn 'advanced' features which are no longer used in practice? I want my money back for Edx on this one.

Terrible class. Instructor responds to people doubt with bad quiz

question with "I'll need to talk to the person who did the class"

and then said quiz was correct even though many people

in the class have explained why question and 'correct' answer are

wrong. Dropped.

Just finished and the class is as bad as other reviewers have mentioned. I got help from a coworker and she was astounded at how bad the material and presentation were (especially the quizzes). It's truly sad to see classes like this on Edx.

The Advanced C++ course by Microsoft via edX is a huge disappointment for the following three reasons:

1. Tutorial videos are barely readable and often inaudible (check module 2 templates for example). The instructor has done a poor job explaining the concepts.

2. The text has many typos and does not meet even the minimum quality standards. Some of the quiz questions and examples are wrong.

3. The text is merely an introduction to the advanced topics and does not go in depth in explaining them. It does not cover any new features added in C++11 and later (i.e. Modern C++).

The only positive point about this course is that some of the most important topics are covered (particularly templates and iterators) in the course.

The first two courses of the series were great with the first one easily being the best as the video lectures were clear, detailed and to the point.

This third course is a huge disappointment. The videos have terrible quality. You can hardly hear what the lecturer is saying as if he's on some kind of medication throughout the lectures. He's practically just mumbling the entire time.

I can recommend the first two courses but not this one.
