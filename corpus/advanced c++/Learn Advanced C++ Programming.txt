Description
This course will take you from a basic knowledge of C++ to using more advanced features of the language. This course is for you if you want to deepen your basic knowledge of C++, you want to learn C++ 11 features, or you've taken my free beginners' C++ course and you're looking for the next step.

We'll start with a look at C++ file handling and move through STL, template classes, operator overloading, lambda expressions, move constructors and much more besides.

At the end of the course I'll show you how to create a program that generates fractal images, using a a few of the language features we've seen in the course and giving you a great work out with smart pointers and arrays.

I'll give you exercises throughout the course, ranging from easy near the start, to quite tricky (but optional!) near the end of the course.

Who this course is for:
This course is for anyone with a basic knowledge of C++ who wants to increase their knowledege
Suitable for anyone who knows C++ 98 and wants to learn C++ 11 features

I'm once again amazed with this course, maybe even more, as I was with the previous free course for beginners. Everything is so well, easy but deeply explained and the final Fractal project is absolutely stunning. If you're thinking about to start with C++ I say go for it, take C++ For Complete Beginners by John first and then this one, you won't regret it.

  After working as a software developer and contractor for over 14 years for a whole bunch of companies including CSC, Proquest, SPSS and AT&T in the UK and Netherlands, I decided to work full-time as a private software trainer. After spending four years in the beautiful city of Budapest, Hungary and a year in Berlin, I now live in my home town of Derby, UK.

Loved the course. Everything was well thought out and, above all else, easy to understand and follow.

So far, I already know the material, but it is good to go over it again. I am a Visual Studio guy, however, I used eclipse so my projects would be identical to those in the course. eclipse is very labor intensive and counter intuitive in it's user interface. I recreated all the projects up until the Fractal project. It became too much for me to follow when each video created a new project with a different name for each additional video adding functionality. About halfway through it, I decided to just watch the remaining videos without creating the projects myself which I had done up to that point. Had I figured out how he was presenting the course earlier, I would have created just one project and modified that same project for succeeding videos. I plan on going back through the project and completing it myself, this time in Visual Studio. Any more courses I take, I will try to use Visual Studio. I really have a hard time with eclipse.

I think the course covered most topics an advanced course would, though it is a little dated in some places. I would have liked the new threading model to have been covered. I have programmed for 26 years, mostly in C++, so I was already acquainted with all the topics presented.

Overall, I am glad I took the course and hope there is a newer version soon.

I like this C++ programming course very much. instead of explaining only C++ syntax, it is better if you cover how the compiler understand the new syntax and internal details

The sound quality isn't great and there aren't any exercises throughout the course. The project at the end is just watching the presenter type in code. I think it would have been better to present the problem so people can go ahead and develop it themselves. I personally don't learn programming through copying someone.

Great course (especially coupled with beginner's course). Not only gets you up and writing programs, but really helps with understanding concepts and principles of the language. Looking to find more courses on Udemy, and especially any more by Mr. Purcell!

Great course!

The final project is a bit complicated, but with some research on google and rewatching the videos several times, the algorithm starts to make sense!

Thanks a lot for this great course!

I greatly enjoyed this course, having followed it through most of the fractal generation section. John explains everything carefully and cogently, injecting a bit of fun in random places. You can tell each lesson has a goal and structure, but he knows the material well enough that he's comfortable showing us how he builds programs steps by steps, warts and all, so we can see how he deals with compile and runtime errors in real time. I think this helps me learn much more than just watching a "perfect" video where the teacher makes no mistakes whatsoever, especially for coding where 99% of the time is spent fixing our own mistakes.

If I had any constructive criticism it is that prior to the fractal generation section it can seem like the video topics are somewhat disconnected in that we move from skill to skill without a clear pattern. However in the fractal section it all comes together, so hang in there. Sometimes things that seem unmotivated or less important to learn at first later on become crucial to my coding approach and knowledge base.

So thanks John and James the TA (who answers questions kindly, promptly, and completely) for a great course!

This course was great for clarification and review of things I learned in my CS degree! Plus there are more than a few things that were mentioned but not covered in school that get a much deeper dive here. I had multiple questions during the course that were all answered within just a few hours. Great job and thanks for putting together a great course for a great learning experience.
