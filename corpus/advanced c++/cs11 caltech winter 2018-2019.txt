CS11 Advanced C++ - Winter 2018-2019
Track Info
We will not be holding meetings for the CS11 Advanced C++ track. All necessary course material is available below.

Contact-info and office hours for this track is as follows:

Donnie Pinkston (donnie AT cms) - by appointment, in 111 Annenberg
Please ask for help if you get stuck on any issue for more than 30 minutes to an hour! Also, if you have a question and you don't want to wait for office hours, feel free to email any or all of us for help.
Assignments
Assignments are generally due one week after they are given. Assignments should be submitted via the csman website. If you need a csman account, or if you need to be added to the Advanced C++ course on csman, email Donnie.

Once I have reviewed your assignment, I will post a review of your submitted code on csman for you to access. If your assignment requires any rework then I will indicate exactly what needs to be fixed. Please complete your rework within one week of receiving feedback.

All of your grades for the term are available on the csman website.

Collaboration Policy
General discussion about assignments is encouraged, but you must write all of your own code. Some assignments build on source-files that I will give you, but other than that, all other files that you work with and/or submit should be entirely your own work.

High-level discussions of implementations (e.g. drawing diagrams of data-structures, or pseudocode sketches of algorithms) are acceptable, but verbatim or near-verbatim copying of implementations is unacceptable, and will be considered an Honor Code violation.
