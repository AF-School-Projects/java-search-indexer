online will be ok but, are you prepared to understand it?.

its not just a matter to read it but to understand the concept and use it correctly and not just because you want to “feel you are a pro”. using something important for something that does not require is even more noob than using something basic for something hard.

You can learn any level of c++ for free.

I would definitely look in YouTube channel. A simple search for me yield good amount of quality videos.
2. Also I would look around free courses offered at Coursera | Online Courses From Top Universities. Join for Free and edX

3. For any programming and STL reference, my usual place is cppreference.com and also The C++ Resources Network

4. Finally, Hot Questions - Stack Exchange is great forum for any programming questions including c++.

C++ is an object-oriented programming language and it includes classes, inheritance, polymorphism, data abstraction and encapsulation. Compared to C, it allows exception handling and function overloading which is not there in c programming language.

To learn advanced C++, a good place to go would be to enroll in our good programming school called Holberton School. We do teach various programming techniques, including C++ from basic up to professional levels. Compared to other means like going to a coding boot camp, we do not charge any upfront fee and that will save you money as you wish to study freely.

A point to not is that it will be hard for you to get a free place where you can learn C++ for free. This is because most of them will charge you a fee in order to access its premium content that is well prepared for you. On the other hand, a completely free means will mean that you will hardly learn all you require in the required time and that means that if you wish to learn comprehensively, you will have to do all the work by yourself. This may be overwhelming on your side and therefore, as a professional software developer, I do not recommend this.
