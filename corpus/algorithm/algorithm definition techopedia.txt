Definition - What does Algorithm mean?
An algorithm is a step by step method of solving a problem. It is commonly used for data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations.

An algorithm is also used to manipulate data in various ways, such as inserting a new data item, searching for a particular item or sorting an item.



Techopedia explains Algorithm
An algorithm is a detailed series of instructions for carrying out an operation or solving a problem. In a non-technical approach, we use algorithms in everyday tasks, such as a recipe to bake a cake or a do-it-yourself handbook.

Technically, computers use algorithms to list the detailed instructions for carrying out an operation. For example, to compute an employee’s paycheck, the computer uses an algorithm. To accomplish this task, appropriate data must be entered into the system.
In terms of efficiency, various algorithms are able to accomplish operations or problem solving easily and quickly.
