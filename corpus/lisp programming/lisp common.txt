The Subversion repository maintenance window completed ahead of schedule at 18:00 on June 1st instead of taking the better part of the weekend. During this maintenance window, Subversion repositories were upgraded to the latest standard (1.9). Some repositories were stored in backward compatible formats as far back as 1.1. With the migration, repository access should benefit from performance work done in the server component. Other features that become available with this maintenance include the storage of merge-tracking information.

The site has always been running its own Trac setup, because we were one of the early Trac adopters. While running our own packages, we've also been lenient to install plugins. Due to improved support in both Trac as well as Debian packages, we were able to move to a full-standard setup.

On Sunday, April 28th, the common-lisp.net hosting infrastructure experienced an outage of approximately 5 hours when we encountered a unexpected difficulty in upgrading our services. As you know, we take our responsiblity towards the integrity of the data and services associated with common-lisp.net seriously. Part of that responsiblity is owning up to our mistakes, so here’s our deeper explanation of how we inadvertently impinged on the integrity of the main host file system.

What is Common Lisp?
Common Lisp is the modern, multi-paradigm, high-performance, compiled, ANSI-standardized, most prominent (along with Scheme) descendant of the long-running family of Lisp programming languages.

Common Lisp is known for being extremely flexible, having excellent support for object oriented programming, and fast prototyping capabilities. It also sports an extremely powerful macro system that allows you to tailor the language to your application, and a flexible run-time environment that allows modification and debugging of running applications (excellent for server-side development and long-running critical software). It is a multi-paradigm programming language that allows you to choose the approach and paradigm according to your application domain.
