About Common Lisp
(defun distance (str1 str2
                 &key (test #'char=))
  "Number of positional differences in
   two equal length strings."
  (when (= (length str1) (length str2))
    (count nil
           (map 'list test str1 str2))))
Common Lisp is an offshoot of the long-running family of Lisp programming languages. It's a multi-paradigm programming language that allows you to choose the approach and paradigm according to your application domain.

Common Lisp has fast prototyping capabilities, and exceptional support for object oriented programming. It also boasts a macro system which allows you to adapt the language to your needs, and a run-time environment which allows modification of running applications.

To learn more about Common Lisp, take a look at the Common Lisp homepage.


Exercism is a great website
Exercism is a great website where I was able to have some very interesting challenges.

I love Lisp, functional programming, and the nostalgia behind Common Lisp.

Lover of functional programming, writing code that writes code for me, and (evidently) parentheses.

I have always been interested in Lisps since taking the SICP course in college. I love the expressiveness and conciseness of the simple syntax, and the ability to build the language upward to meet the domain.

I dabble with Common Lisp and find it interesting because of minimal syntax and the amazing functionalities which the syntax brings.

I fell in love with Common Lisp for its interactivity, metaprogramming and uniform syntax. If I have any say, it's usually my language of choice for both professional and personal projects.
Fun. Challenging. Interesting
