QUERY function
Runs a Google Visualization API Query Language query across data.

Sample Usage
QUERY(A2:E6,"select avg(A) pivot B")

QUERY(A2:E6,F2,FALSE)

Syntax
QUERY(data, query, [headers])

data - The range of cells to perform the query on.

Each column of data can only hold boolean, numeric (including date/time types) or string values.

In case of mixed data types in a single column, the majority data type determines the data type of the column for query purposes. Minority data types are considered null values.

query - The query to perform, written in the Google Visualization API Query Language.

The value for query must either be enclosed in quotation marks or be a reference to a cell containing the appropriate text.

See https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/querylanguage for further details on the query language.

headers - [ OPTIONAL ] - The number of header rows at the top of data. If omitted or set to -1, the value is guessed based on the content of data.
