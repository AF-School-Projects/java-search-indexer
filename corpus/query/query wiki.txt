 Hi, reader in the U.S., it seems you use Wikipedia a lot; that's great! It's a little awkward to ask, but this Wednesday we need your help. Time is running out in 2019 to help us. We’re a non-profit and we don't have salespeople. We depend on donations averaging $16.36, and fewer than 2% of readers give. If you donate just $2.75, the price of your Wednesday coffee, Wikipedia could keep thriving. Thank you.
