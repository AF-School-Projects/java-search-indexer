(Submitted on 12 Jan 2019)
We propose nnstreamer, a software system that handles neural networks as filters of stream pipelines, applying the stream processing paradigm to neural network applications. A new trend with the wide-spread of deep neural network applications is on-device AI; i.e., processing neural networks directly on mobile devices or edge/IoT devices instead of cloud servers. Emerging privacy issues, data transmission costs, and operational costs signifies the need for on-device AI especially when a huge number of devices with real-time data processing are deployed. Nnstreamer efficiently handles neural networks with complex data stream pipelines on devices, improving the overall performance significantly with minimal efforts. Besides, nnstreamer simplifies the neural network pipeline implementations and allows reusing off-shelf multimedia stream filters directly; thus it reduces the developmental costs significantly. Nnstreamer is already being deployed with a product releasing soon and is open source software applicable to a wide range of hardware architectures and software platforms.
