Abstract:
Parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer science, mainly in the form of multi core processors. One software approach for parallel programming, is writing programs in streaming model. A stream program is type of computer program such that the input data is stream of data. In this paper we have used stream programming model, and developed the parallel version of bubble sort algorithm. Our source codes are simple java code and used JStream java library. Our algorithm doesn't have any loop statement, witch is increases the time complexity of algorithms. We have chosen bubble sort, because it is the oldest and slowest sorting algorithm with time complexity level of O(n 2 ). In this paper we have shown that our algorithm has lower time complexity. Also our code shows that writing parallel programs in streaming model would be very simple.

I Introduction
Parallel computing is a form of computation in witch many calculations are carried simultaneously [1]. It is now well established that parallel computing is moving into the mainstream with a rapid increase in the adoption of multi core processors. Unlike previous generations of mainstream hardware evolution, this shift will have a major impact on existing and future software [2] [3].
